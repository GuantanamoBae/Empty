# Empty
This is a repository where stuff will be placed. It is purposefully named with a spiteful name because it is not yet full but will be when we are finished.

# Purpose
The purpose of the Empty repo is to teach various `git` skills and interactions. Individuals wanting to learn should fork, open a pull request, and be familiar with common interactions on Github.

# Skills
This is a great repo to practice anything. In this case, Markdown is being practiced on this README file. You'll note that more `.md` file types should be added to explain random things that seem Empty but need to be full.

# Future
Is a pretty decent rapper I guess.
